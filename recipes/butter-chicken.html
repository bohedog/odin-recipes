<h3>India's greatest creation</h3>

<p>Butter chicken. India's greatest delicacy and creation altogether.</p> 
<p>Without Butter chicken (Yes it deserves a capital letter), the entire world would come to a halt.
</p>

<p>There is no world without Butter chicken. People may think of this as a joke but they are mistaken.</p>

<p>However with such great taste, comes great responsibilities.</p>

<p>You must make sure the person who is making your Butter chicken is of indian descent.</p>

<p>White people, asian people, black people are all welcome to create and eat this dish however</p>

<p>I will not <strong>TOLERATE</strong> Butter chicken that is not made by an indian or pakistani or someone along the lines of those races</p>

<p>Even in Korea, I tried Butter chicken at multiple locations, only to be disappointed</p>

<p>Then I found this indian lady in Gangnam Seoul</p>

<p>As soon as I went in, the entire room had a crazy indian scent with a bollywood movie playing on the TV with indian music also playing on the speaker</p>

<p>You might think im joking but the address is 서울 강남구 선릉로152길 5 B1 칸티푸르 청담점</p>

<p>But the moment I saw the Indian owner and Indian kitchen staff I knew I was at the right place</p>

<p>Ok i cant be fucked typing anymore but the food is fire i reccomend 10/10</p>
